# Two-Way Morse Code Using LabVIEW

A Signals and Systems Final Project. Using National Instrument LabVIEW and a Data Acquisition System for an automatic communication system with text to Morse Code

## Current Project Status

The project will not have consistent updates. However, there are plans to improve on the system namely:
1. Switching from Live Sentence to Live Letter Translation
2. Switch to telegraph mode
3. Adaptive signal translator in conjunction to the telegraph mode
4. Audio transmission and reciever

## Installation

Download the VI Program in releases. Program requires the use of National Instruments LabVIEW Software and its proprietary Data Acquisition System. An Excel file is required for translation from string to morse code signals and vice versa.


## Usage

The system is split into two main tabs, the Transmitter (1) and Receiver (2).

Transmitter controls the speed of the output signal and includes the string input.

The receiver has the input signal and translates the input to morse code and its string counterparts.


## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
