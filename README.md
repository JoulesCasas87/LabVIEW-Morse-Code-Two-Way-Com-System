# Two-Way Morse Code Using LabVIEW

A Signals and Systems Final Project. Using National Instruments LabVIEW and a Data Acquisition System for an automatic communication system with text to Morse Code

## Installation

Download the VI Program. Program requires the use of National Instruments LabVIEW Software and its proprietary Data Acquisition System. An Excel file is required for translation from string to morse code signals and vice versa.


## Usage

The system is split into two main tabs, the Transmitter (1) and Receiver (2).

Transmitter controls the speed of the output signal and includes the string input.

The receiver has the input signal and translates the input to morse code and its string counterparts.
